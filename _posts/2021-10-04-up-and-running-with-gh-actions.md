description: Automate your GitHub repo and make your life a bit easier with GitHub Actions
---

## Summary:

The goal of this post is to give an overview of a few GitHub Actions I have been employing in some of my projects and explain how they have helped me out so far.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are a CI/CD tool within the GitHub Ecosystem, that allows developers to easily setup automated workflows around your repositories.

This just sounds like `Travis CI` or `Azure Pipelines`, why is it better?

One major reason I'd reason to say it is better than some of those other options is the fact its directly integrated into GitHub, which makes interacting with its resources easier and convenient.
